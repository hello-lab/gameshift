## 💎 The Glitch System

As you progress, glitches are introduced to make the game harder:

### Glitch Types

1. **COLOR SWAP** - A green or yellow tile randomly changes to the opposite color
2. **FAKE LETTER** - A gray letter is shown as yellow (it's not in the word)
3. **LETTER MUTATION** - A letter changes to a random different letter
4. **PHANTOM GREEN** - A gray tile is shown as green (it's not actually correct)
5. **REVERSE COLORS** - Green and yellow colors swap for that word
6. **INVISIBLE TILE** - A tile's feedback is hidden from you
7. **DELAYED FEEDBACK** - Feedback appears after a delay
8. **LENGTH SHIFT** - The word length is displayed incorrectly

### Progressive Difficulty

- **Words 1-3**: Minor glitches (0-2 glitches)
- **Words 4-6**: Medium glitches (2-3 glitches)
- **Words 7-9**: Chaos glitches (3-5 glitches)
- **Words 10**: Psychological glitches (5-6 glitches) - Most challenging!

## 🧠 Strategy & Tips

### Tips for Success

1. **Start with common letters**: Q, U, E, A, R, S, T
2. **Look for patterns**: The glitch system hints at real feedback sometimes
3. **Don't trust colors fully**: Glitches can deceive you
4. **Use process of elimination**: Mark letters you've ruled out
5. **Try common word patterns**: -ING, -ER, -ED, TH-, ST-

### Dealing with Glitches

1. **PHANTOM GREEN**: If a green tile seems wrong, it might be a glitch
2. **FAKE LETTER**: A yellow letter might not be in the word
3. **COLOR SWAP**: Remember colors might be reversed
4. **DELAYED FEEDBACK**: Wait a moment for feedback to appear

### Planning Your Guesses

- **Guess 1**: Use a common word with 3 vowels (PLANE, STARE)
- **Guess 2**: Test different consonants based on feedback
- **Guess 3+**: Narrow down based on confirmed letters
- **Final guess**: Use remaining guesses strategically

## 🎨 Color Guide

| Color | Meaning | Reliability |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Green** | Letter in correct position | Often true (check if glitches active!) |
| **Yellow** | Letter in word, wrong spot | Often true (fake letters possible) |
| **Gray** | Letter not in word | Often true (phantom greens possible) |

**Note**: With glitches active, colors can be misleading. Trust your logic!
